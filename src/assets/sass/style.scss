//As you can see, there is only one Sass file at the root level: main.scss. 
/*All the other files are divided into appropriate folders and prefixed with an underscore 
(_) to tell Sass they are partial .scss files that shouldn’t be compiled to .css files. 
Indeed, it is the base file’s role to import and merge all of those.
“One file to rule them all,
One file to find them,
One file to bring them all,
And in the Sass way merge them.”
